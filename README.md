## Welcome to the jungle! 👋

<!--
# 👋 Hi, I'm Jakub Zahumensky

🎯 **Aspiring Data Scientist transitioning from academic research to industry**  
📍 Based in Prague, Czech Republic  
🚗 Interested in automotive data science, machine learning & data-driven mobility solutions

---

## 🧠 Background

I'm a trained molecular biologist with a strong research background in **quantitative fluorescence microscopy**, **automated image analysis**, and **large-scale data processing**. I spent several years investigating how membrane microdomains organize key processes in yeast cells, during which I developed and implemented:

- Automated analysis workflows using **Fiji (ImageJ macros, 1500–2000 lines)**  
- Batch data processing and **statistical analysis using R**  
- Visualization techniques including **PCA, clustering, and heatmaps** for microscopy, **lipidomics**, and **NGS** datasets

## 💡 My Transition to Data Science

🔁 While working with complex datasets in biology, I discovered a passion for **data wrangling**, **pattern recognition**, and **automated pipelines**. This led me to pivot toward **data science**, particularly in the **automotive and mobility** sector, where similar analytical challenges meet real-world impact.

I'm currently focused on:

- 🐍 Learning **Python for data science** (transitioning from R)
- 📊 Exploring **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** for efficient data manipulation and visualization
- 🤖 Diving into **scikit-learn** for classical machine learning
- 🚘 Understanding **automotive data formats** and protocols relevant to smart mobility and EVs

---

## 🚀 Current Goals

- Build portfolio projects involving:
  - Automotive sensor/log data analysis
  - Predictive modeling
  - Real-time data pipelines
- Contribute to open-source projects in automotive or microscopy-related data analysis
- Prepare for industry roles in **data-driven mobility**, **autonomous vehicles**, or **EV analytics**
