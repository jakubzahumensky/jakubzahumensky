# 🌴 Welcome to the jungle! 🦜
🎯 Aspiring Data Scientist  
🚗 Interested in science, machine learning & data-driven solutions to real-world problems

## 🧠 Background

I'm a trained biophysicist with a strong research background in **quantitative fluorescence microscopy**, **automated image analysis**, and **large-scale data processing**. I spent several years investigating how membrane microdomains organize key processes in yeast cells, during which I developed and implemented:

- Automated analysis workflows using **Fiji (ImageJ) macros**  
- Batch data processing and **statistical analysis using R**  
- Visualization techniques including **PCA and heatmaps** for microscopy, **lipidomics**, and **NGS** datasets

## 💡 My Transition to Data Science

🔁 While working with complex datasets in cellular biology and microscopy, I discovered a passion for **data wrangling**, **pattern recognition**, and **automated pipelines**, which led me to pivot toward **data science**.

---

## 🚀 Current goals
I'm currently focused on:
- 🐍 Learning **Python for data science** (transitioning from R)
- 📊 Exploring **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** for efficient data manipulation and visualization
- 🤖 Diving into **scikit-learn** for classical machine learning
